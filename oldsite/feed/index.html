				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The Problem:</b></p>
<p>I am a small to medium sized employer with 50 employees. Most of my employees are professional individuals with highly sought after skills.  I am concerned that if I don’t invest in my most talented individuals I may lose them to the competition.  What do I do as I don’t want to spend the earth developing a high-tech solution?</p>
<p><b>The Solution:</b></p>
<p>In this scenario a good place to start is to be clear about how you define talent in your business, as there are many differing views.</p>
<p>In a recent CIPD (Chartered institute of Personnel and Development) fact sheet August 2013, talent was defined as:</p>
<p>“Those individuals who can make a difference to an organisations performance either through their immediate contribution or the longer term, by demonstrating the highest levels of potential.”</p>
<p>Once you have defined what ‘talent’ is, the next step is to consider how you identify it.  You may feel that ‘gut feel’ is the best way, however it is advisable to show consistency in selection if challenged by others.</p>
<p>Consider the following simple steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the employees most recent performance review, how are they performing against such things as:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Objectives</li>
<li>Job responsibilities</li>
<li>Core competencies and behaviours</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Benchmark the employee against the  role  profile and job description are there areas where they excel above their peers</li>
<li>Develop a bespoke development centre for employees that aims to measure them against the key accountabilities for a job (either a current role or a job that they aspire to have).  This will provide you with an understanding of the gap in their development and assist you in developing a specific programme.</li>
<li> Use these tools to develop a talent mapping tool for all employees in your business this way you can understand the potential of all your employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having identified your talent, the next step is to build an appropriate development programme for an individual or group of individuals.  The aim of these programmes needs to satisfy the aims of the business and meet the individual objectives and aspirations of the employee.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a Personal Development Plan (PDP).  Here a bespoke programme is developed for the individual that aims to help them to plan their career and the vital next steps.  It utilises a variety of tools including psychometrics.</li>
<li>Develop a mentoring programme, marrying up talent with senior leaders in the organisation.</li>
<li>Develop opportunities for individuals to gain experiences in other roles, thus growing the experience of the individual and giving them the ability to work in a variety of different roles. There could even be opportunities in other divisions or in other countries.</li>
<li>Develop a study policy that allows individuals to be sponsored to gain further professional qualifications.</li>
<li>Consider how you wish to reward and recognise the talent in your business.  Some suggestions could be:
<ul>
<li>Public recognition of their success, i.e. on Company website, blog etc</li>
<li>Assignment to a crucial business project</li>
<li>Sign them up to a business seminar, e.g. The London Business Forum</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Above all, it is import that you communicate with the individual to let them know that you believe that they are a talent worth investing in.</p>
<p><b>Other things to consider:</b></p>
<p>Use your talent planning tool to assist in workforce planning and areas where you may be exposed to an individual leaving or moving through the organisation.</p>
<p>Set yourself a target for how many employees you would want to develop internally and those that you would recruit externally.</p>

<p><b>The Problem:</b></p>
<p>I have an employee who is persistently off sick for short bursts of time with a variety of ailments.  When I speak to them I feel it’s genuine, but then one of their colleagues tells me they have seen them in the pub.  What’s the best way to address this issue, as when this employee is here, they are my best performer?</p>
<p><b>The Solution:</b></p>
<p>According to figures from PwC (PwC Blog, July 2013) the cost of sickness absence in UK Companies is almost £29 billion.  As a small business, sickness absence can make the difference between profit and loss. Therefore it’s important to have a clear policy on absence &#8211; and in this case &#8211; how you will treat short-term absences.</p>
<p>Consider the following when drafting your policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a company sick scheme in addition to Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) and if so how long do you pay it for?</li>
<li>What is the procedure for absence reporting?</li>
<li>What is your procedure for returning to work? Do you require all employees to have an interview upon their return?</li>
<li>Is there a formal process to follow when you feel an individual is taking too much sick? Do you need to put set trigger points in place?</li>
<li>What processes do you have in place to help and support individuals, for example: flexible working patterns?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Where do you go from here?</b></p>
<p>In this scenario, firstly have a conversation with the person concerned highlighting the level of absence they have had over recent months.  Tell them how this relates to your procedure. Ask the employee if there is any specific reason for the absence and if there is support you can offer, such as flexible working patterns.</p>
<p>Agree a set of next steps &#8211; for example &#8211; next time they are off sick they will be required to attend a return to work meeting immediately thereafter.</p>
<p>If you have an established policy, has the individual been following the necessary procedures?</p>
<p>If not, this should be addressed with the employee and you may need to take appropriate action in accordance with your policies and procedures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The Problem:</b></p>
<p>Recently I have been advertising for a role and have received multiple applications that appear to be from the same person &#8211; however they have used a series of different names. I want to make sure that I am fair in my assessment of all candidates and don’t fall foul of any employment legislation. What should I do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Solution:</b></p>
<p>It is really important that in all your recruitment processes you establish a fair selection procedure.This will relate to how you advertise role; how you screen CVs; the process and questions you use at interview and selection meetings and how you arrive at the recruitment decision.</p>
<p>This will assist in avoiding claims of discrimination at interview stage.</p>
<p>Under the provision of the Equality Act 2010, an individual can bring the following protective characteristics discrimination claims against a potential employer:</p>
<ul>
<li> Age</li>
<li>Disability</li>
<li>Gender reassignment</li>
<li>Sex</li>
<li>Sexual orientation</li>
<li>Pregnancy and maternity</li>
<li>Marriage and civil partnership</li>
<li>Race</li>
<li>Religion or belief</li>
</ul>
<p>To assist in avoiding the potential of a claim, make sure you assess each CV against a written set of criteria that you are looking for the individuals to demonstrate on their CV.  This could include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the candidate eligible to work in the UK.</li>
<li>Does the candidate have the minimum qualifications specified as necessary for the role.</li>
<li>Does the candidate have multi-site experience.</li>
<li>Does the candidate have experience in specific sectors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Be mindful that you need to make sure that your initial screening criteria are not in themselves discriminatory.</p>
<p><b>Where do you go from here?</b></p>
<p>For each of these areas, set a specific score based on your interpretation of the CV, and apply this consistently to all the CVs you review.</p>
<p>Make sure you keep a record of the scores. This means you are able compare all the CVs and select only those with the best scores.  You will also have all the information to hand should a candidate ask why they were unsuccessful.</p>
<p><b>Feel like you need to know more?</b><b> </b></p>
