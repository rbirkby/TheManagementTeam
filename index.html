      Thank you Julie for your dedicated time in getting to know Sabio, its brand and culture, which really played a vital role in making this day an amazing success. Often teambuilding days seem to have few practical outcomes you can immediately bring back into the workplace. I can certainly say that thanks to your design and facilitation, that wasn't the case with this one: quick wins were transferred, with the momentum for change still going strong!
